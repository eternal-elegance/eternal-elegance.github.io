					<h3><strong>Coronavirus aka COVID-19</strong></h3>

					<p id="covid">
						<span class="imp">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly
							discovered
							coronavirus.</span>

						Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience <span class="imp">mild to moderate
							respiratory
							illness and recover without requiring special treatment.</span> Older people, and those with
						underlying
						<span class="imp">medical problems</span> like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
						respiratory disease, and cancer
						are more likely to develop serious illness.

						The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is <span class="imp">being well informed about the COVID-19 virus,
							the disease it causes and how it spreads.</span>
						Protect yourself and others from infection by <span class="imp">washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub
							frequently and not touching your face.</span>

						The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when
						an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory
						etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

						At this time, there are <span class="dngr">no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19</span>. However, there are many
						ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments.

					<h3><strong>Plague</strong></h3>

					<p id="plague">
						Plague is an <span class="dngr">infectious disease</span> caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, usually found in small
						mammals and their fleas. The disease is <span class="imp">transmitted between animals via their fleas</span> and, as it
						is a zoonotic bacteriuma, it can also <span class="dngr">transmit from animals to humans</span>.

						Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a <span class="imp">case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60%</span> for the
						bubonic type, and is <span class="dngr">always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated</span>.

						People infected with Y. pestis often develop symptoms after an <span class="imp">incubation period of one to seven
							days.</span>

						It was <span class="dngr">known as the "Black Death"</span> during the fourteenth century, causing more than 50 million
						deaths in <Europe class="span safe"> Nowadays, plague is easily treated with antibiotics</Europe> and the use of standard
						precautions to prevent acquiring infection.

					<h3><strong>Spanish Flu or Influenza</strong></h3>

					<p id="inf">
						The Spanish flu, also known as the 1918 flu pandemic, <span class="imp">was an unusually deadly influenza pandemic
							caused by the H1N1 influenza A virus.</span>

						The first observations of illness and mortality were documented in United States,Germany and
						United Kingdom.

						<span class="dngr">Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill the very young and the very old</span>, <span class="safe">with a higher
							survival rate for those in between</span>, but the Spanish flu pandemic resulted in a higher than
						expected mortality rate for young adults.

						The Spanish flu infected around 500 million people this flu is <span class="dngr">regardless considered to be one
							of the deadliest pandemics in history.</span>

						It was identified very substantial heterogeneity in published estimates, ranging from less than
						1 to more than 10,000 deaths per 100,000 cases or infections (Influenza 2009).

						The time from infection to illness, known as <span class="imp">the incubation period, is about 2 days, but ranges
							from one to four days.</span>

						<span class="safe">The most effective way to prevent the disease is vaccination</span>. Safe and effective vaccines are
						available and have been used for more than 60 years.

						Among healthy adults, <span class="safe">influenza vaccine provides protection</span>, <span class="imp">even when circulating viruses do
							not exactly match the vaccine viruses</span>.

					<h3><strong>Cholera</strong></h3>

					<p id="chol">
						Cholera is the result of a lack of adequate water and sanitation.
						It is an acute <span class="imp">diarrhoeal</span> disease that can kill within hours if left untreated.

						Researchers have estimated that each year there are 1.3 million to 4.0 million cases of cholera,
						and 21 000 to 143 000 deaths worldwide due to cholera (1).

						<span class="imp">It takes between 12 hours and 5 days for a person to show symptoms after ingesting contaminated
							food or water.
						</span>
						<span class="dngr">Cholera affects both children and adults and can kill within hours if untreated.
						</span>
						Most people infected with V. cholerae do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are
						present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment,
						potentially infecting other people.

						<span class="safe">Up to 80% of cases can be successfully treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS).
